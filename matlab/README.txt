1) Compiling

  After building the LibHand C++ library in hand_cpp, you can compile
  the MATLAB stuff here
    ./mex_compile.sh

  Hopefully nothing else will be needed for compilation.

  There are some known fixable problems with MATLAB installations,
  please check the INSTALL.txt in the LibHand root directory for more
  detailed information.

2) MATLAB setup

  The compiled plugin will reside in the directory 'dist', along with
  some helper files.

  The MATLAB examples are in the 'examples' directory

  You just need to add 'dist' to your MATLAB path and you are good to
  go. The program "add_paths.m" in the examples directory adds the
  path for you

3) Running the examples

  cd into the examples directory and try them out

  If you didn't add the dist folder to your MATLAB path, just run
  add_paths before running the examples.
