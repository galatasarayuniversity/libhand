  (1) General Install Notes
----------------------------------------

**************************************************
REMINDER: 
  Make sure to check www.libhand.org for updates.
  There might be pre-compiled versions of dependencies or even the
  LibHand code, making the installation much easier.
**************************************************

To build libhand, you will need at least CMake 2.8.6 (very recent at the
time of the LibHand release).
CMake is available for both MacOS and Linux.

LibHand depends on the Boost library, the OGRE library and the OpenCV
library. To simplify the deployment of LibHand, it is built statically
against OGRE. If you do not plan to use LibHand inside MATLAB, you can make
in a completely dynamic library environment but that mode of operation is
not officially supported.

This means that you will have to obtain a static version of the OGRE
library. On MacOS X, a static version of OpenCV is also required.

Both OGRE and OpenCV provide build instructions. There's pre-compiled
versions of these libraries on www.libhand.org for some platforms.

----------------------------------------
  (2) Installing Dependencies on MacOS X
----------------------------------------

For a lot of MacOS X open-source development, MacPorts is a
pre-requisite. Please install MacPorts first, available from this link:

To install boost, do:

  sudo port install boost

To install a static version of OGRE simply do:

  sudo port install ogre

To install a static version of OpenCV, you have to build it from source
using the instructions at http://www.opencv.org/ or try out the pre-built
OpenCV package supplied on www.libhand.org.

A dynamic+static version of OpenCV is currently under review  for
MacPorts. In the future, a simple

sudo port install opencv
might be all that is needed.

A static version of OpenCV is needed primarily for the MATLAB build. If you
do not plan to use MATLAB, you can install a dynamic version of OpenCV.

To install cmake, do:
  sudo port install cmake

For a less quirky file open/save dialog you can install the MacPorts version
of Tk:

  sudo port install tk

----------------------------------------
   (2.1) MATLAB precautions for MacOS X
----------------------------------------

MacOS X 10.7 arrived with a completely new compiler system enabled by
default -- clang. 
When MATLAB R2011b shipped, the manufacturer did not anticipate clang
becoming  the default. Thus MATLAB R2011b needs to be patched before
it can compile code on MacOS X 10.7.


----------------------------------------
   (3) Installing Dependencies on Ubuntu Linux
----------------------------------------

Get the dependent low-level libraries by running:

sudo apt-get install doxygen libxaw7-dev libxrandr-dev tcl tk \
     libois-dev libtbb-dev libzzip-dev libfreeimage-dev \
     libboost-thread-dev libboost-date-time-dev \
     libjpeg-dev libtiff4-dev libbz2-dev subversion 

There is a utility script for a smoother installation of OGRE v1.7.3.
You can find it inside the install_help directory.

The OpenCV library is available through apt-get. A static version of OpenCV
is not required under Ubuntu Linux.

----------------------------------------
   (3.1) Installing a brand new OpenCV on Ubuntu Linux
----------------------------------------
svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/opencv/branches/2.3/opencv opencv

cd opencv
mkdir release
cd release

cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -D BUILD_PYTHON_SUPPORT=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF ..

make -j2
sudo make install
cd ../..

----------------------------------------
   (3.2) Installing CMake 2.8.6. on Linux
----------------------------------------
wget http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.6.tar.gz
tar xzvf cmake-2.8.6.tar.gz
cd cmake-2.8.6

make -j4
sudo make install

The "-j4" is assuming that you have a 4-core CPU. This flag speeds up
the compilation significantly. You can provide a different number if
you have more or less cores.

----------------------------------------
   (3.2) MATLAB precautions for Linux
----------------------------------------

On most newer Linux distributions, you have to start MATLAB with a
special LD_PRELOAD directive. MATLAB ships with older versions of
libraries. Technically MATLAB only supports certain versions of the
GCC C/C++ Compiler Suite. Realistically, the versions supported by
MATLAB are old enough to be very difficult to install on a newer Linux
distribution.

Instead, MATLAB can be coerced to start up with newer C/C++ libraries
and this usually works without problems.

Load MATLAB with:

LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 /usr/local/MATLAB/R2011b/bin/matlab

(feel free to replace R2011b by your specific release of MATLAB)

----------------------------------------
   (4) Compiling everything in LibHand
----------------------------------------

First the LibHand C++ library needs to be installed.

Make sure you have installed all of the dependencies for your OS.

You will execute an "out-of-source" CMake build.

cd hand_cpp
mkdir -p build
cd build

cmake ..

CMake will run, configure LibHand and print out some build
diagnostics. If there are errors, feel free to report to the LibHand
author Marin Saric: marin.saric@gmail.com. The build diagnostics can
be used to debug the build problems.

Next, start the LibHand build

make -j4

The "-j4" option denotes the number of cores for your CPU, to make
things build a little faster.

Next, make LibHand project install the libraries and the accompanying
config files into the "hand_cpp/dist" folder. This will not write
anything into your system directories and you do not need root for
this step:

make install

If there are no errors, you can test the LibHand library by running
the pose designer. From the root of the libhand directory, you can
call

hand_cpp/build/source/pose_designer

----------------------------------------
   (4.1) Compiling the examples
----------------------------------------

If step (4) succeded, the examples should compile without hassle.

From the root of the LibHand distribution:

cd examples
mkdir -p build
cd build

cmake ..
make

The compiled example code will be located inside the build
directory. You can run it to make sure it's working

----------------------------------------
   (4.2) Compiling the MATLAB interface
----------------------------------------

Before beginning this step, it is useful make sure that the mex compiler provided
with MATLAB is working. Try compiling some MATLAB mex example code.

Make sure that you read the MATLAB precautions in sections 2.1 or 3.3

If you are sure that mex works well, then you can proceed

Doing

cd matlab
./mex_compile.sh

should take care of everything.

The MATLAB interface will live in "matlab/dist"

There is example code in "matlab/examples"

Start MATLAB, then cd into the "matlab/examples" directory.

Type
add_paths
simple_render

simple_render should show you a rendered image of a human hand.
